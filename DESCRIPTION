Description: Variable transformation and harmonization for the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) from
            2001 to 2014. This package transforms and harmonizes variables from each CCHS cycle into a standardized
            set of variables. This package is useful for researchers interested in using Canadian population health data
            across multiple years.
