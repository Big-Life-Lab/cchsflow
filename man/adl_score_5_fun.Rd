\title{ADL help score (count of tasks requiring help)}
\usage{
adl_score_5_fun(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{ADL_01}{A numeric value indicating if help is needed preparing meals.
Valid values: 1 = needs help, 2 = does not need help, "NA(a)" = not applicable,
"NA(b)" = missing.}

\item{ADL_02}{A numeric value indicating if help is needed getting to
appointments/errands. Valid values: 1 = needs help, 2 = does not need help,
"NA(a)" = not applicable, "NA(b)" = missing.}

\item{ADL_03}{A numeric value indicating if help is needed doing housework.
Valid values: 1 = needs help, 2 = does not need help, "NA(a)" = not applicable,
"NA(b)" = missing.}

\item{ADL_04}{A numeric value indicating if help is needed doing personal care.
Valid values: 1 = needs help, 2 = does not need help, "NA(a)" = not applicable,
"NA(b)" = missing.}

\item{ADL_05}{A numeric value indicating if help is needed moving inside house.
Valid values: 1 = needs help, 2 = does not need help, "NA(a)" = not applicable,
"NA(b)" = missing.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the count of ADL tasks requiring help:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{0}: No tasks require help
    \item \code{1}: One task requires help
    \item \code{2}: Two tasks require help
    \item \code{3}: Three tasks require help
    \item \code{4}: Four tasks require help
    \item \code{5}: All five tasks require help
    \item \code{"NA(a)"}: Not applicable (if any input is "NA(a)")
    \item \code{"NA(b)"}: Missing (if any input is "NA(b)")
  }
}
\description{
Counts the number of activities of daily living (ADL) tasks
  that require help, creating a 6-category variable (0-5). This provides
  a more granular measure of functional limitation compared to the binary
  ADL indicator. Uses ADL variables that are consistent across all CCHS
  cycles from 2001 to 2014.

\examples{
# Person needing no help with any tasks
adl_score_5_fun(ADL_01 = 2, ADL_02 = 2, ADL_03 = 2, ADL_04 = 2, ADL_05 = 2)
# Returns: 0

# Person needing help with two tasks
adl_score_5_fun(ADL_01 = 1, ADL_02 = 2, ADL_03 = 1, ADL_04 = 2, ADL_05 = 2)
# Returns: 2 (help needed with meals and housework)

# Person needing help with all tasks
adl_score_5_fun(ADL_01 = 1, ADL_02 = 1, ADL_03 = 1, ADL_04 = 1, ADL_05 = 1)
# Returns: 5

# Missing data example
adl_score_5_fun(ADL_01 = "NA(b)", ADL_02 = 1, ADL_03 = 1, ADL_04 = 2, ADL_05 = 2)
# Returns: "NA(b)" (any missing value results in missing score)
