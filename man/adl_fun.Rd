\usage{
adl_fun(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{ADL_01}{A numeric value indicating if help is needed preparing meals.
Valid values: 1 = needs help, 2 = does not need help.}

\item{ADL_02}{A numeric value indicating if help is needed getting to
appointments/errands. Valid values: 1 = needs help, 2 = does not need help.}

\item{ADL_03}{A numeric value indicating if help is needed doing housework.
Valid values: 1 = needs help, 2 = does not need help.}

\item{ADL_04}{A numeric value indicating if help is needed doing personal care.
Valid values: 1 = needs help, 2 = does not need help.}

\item{ADL_05}{A numeric value indicating if help is needed moving inside house.
Valid values: 1 = needs help, 2 = does not need help.}
}
\value{
A numeric value with the following categories:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{1}: Needs help with at least one task
    \item \code{2}: Does not need help with any task
    \item \code{"NA(b)"}: Missing or invalid input values
  }
}
\description{
Creates a binary indicator variable for whether a person needs
  help with any activities of daily living. This harmonized variable is based
  on the CCHS derived variable ADLF6R but uses ADL variables that are
  consistent across all CCHS survey cycles.
}
\details{
The CCHS derived variable ADLF6R uses different ADL variables across
 the various CCHS survey cycles. This newly derived variable (ADL_der) uses
 ADL variables that are consistent across CCHS cycles.
 
 In the 2001 CCHS survey cycle, the ADLF6R variable examines the following
 ADL variables:
 \enumerate{
  \item ADL_01 - Needs help preparing meals
  \item ADL_02 - Needs help getting to appointments/errands
  \item ADL_03 - Needs help doing housework
  \item ADL_04 - Needs help doing personal care
  \item ADL_05 - Needs help moving inside house
  \item ADL_07 - Needs help doing heavy household chores
 }  

 In the 2003-2005 CCHS survey cycles, the ADLF6R variable examines the
 following ADL variables:
 \enumerate{
  \item ADL_01 - Needs help preparing meals
  \item ADL_02 - Needs help getting to appointments/errands
  \item ADL_03 - Needs help doing housework
  \item ADL_04 - Needs help doing personal care
  \item ADL_05 - Needs help moving inside house
  \item ADL_06 - Needs help doing finances
  \item ADL_07 - Needs help doing heavy household chores
 }
 
 In the 2007-2014 CCHS survey cycles, the ADLF6R variable examines the
 following ADL variables:
 \enumerate{
  \item ADL_01 - Needs help preparing meals
  \item ADL_02 - Needs help getting to appointments/errands
  \item ADL_03 - Needs help doing housework
  \item ADL_04 - Needs help doing personal care
  \item ADL_05 - Needs help moving inside house
  \item ADL_06 - Needs help doing finances
 }
 
 This newly derived variable (ADL_der) uses ADL_01 to ADL_05 which are
 consistent across all survey cycles. For any single CCHS survey year,
 it is appropriate to use ADLF6R. ADL_der is recommended when using multiple
 survey cycles.

\examples{
# Person who needs help with at least one task
adl_fun(ADL_01 = 1, ADL_02 = 2, ADL_03 = 2, ADL_04 = 2, ADL_05 = 2)
# Returns: 1 (needs help with preparing meals)

# Person who needs no help with any task
adl_fun(ADL_01 = 2, ADL_02 = 2, ADL_03 = 2, ADL_04 = 2, ADL_05 = 2)
# Returns: 2 (does not need help)

# Person who needs help with multiple tasks
adl_fun(ADL_01 = 1, ADL_02 = 1, ADL_03 = 2, ADL_04 = 2, ADL_05 = 2)
# Returns: 1 (needs help with meals and appointments)

# Invalid input
adl_fun(ADL_01 = 0, ADL_02 = 2, ADL_03 = 2, ADL_04 = 2, ADL_05 = 2)
# Returns: "NA(b)" (invalid input value)
