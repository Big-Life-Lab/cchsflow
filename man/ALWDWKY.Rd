\description{
\strong{NOTE:} this is not a function.

 This is a continuous variable derived by Statistics Canada that quantifies
 the amount of alcohol that is consumed in a week. This is calculated by
 adding the number of drinks consumed each day in the past week.
 Respondents of each CCHS cycle are asked how much alcohol they have
 consumed each day in the past week (ie. how much alcohol did you consume on
 Sunday, how much did you consume on Monday etc.). Each day is considered an
 individual variable and ALWDWKY takes the sum of all daily variables.
}
\details{
This variable is present in every CCHS cycle used in cchsflow, and
 how it was derived remains consistent.
