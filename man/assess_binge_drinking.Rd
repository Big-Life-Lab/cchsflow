\arguments{
\item{DHH_SEX}{CCHS variable for sex (1=male, 2=female). Accepts raw CCHS codes or preprocessed values.}

\item{ALW_1}{Had drinks in past week (1=yes, 2=no). Accepts raw CCHS codes or preprocessed values.}

\item{ALW_2A1}{Number of drinks on Sunday. Accepts raw CCHS codes or preprocessed values.}

\item{ALW_2A2}{Number of drinks on Monday. Accepts raw CCHS codes or preprocessed values.}

\item{ALW_2A3}{Number of drinks on Tuesday. Accepts raw CCHS codes or preprocessed values.}

\item{ALW_2A4}{Number of drinks on Wednesday. Accepts raw CCHS codes or preprocessed values.}

\item{ALW_2A5}{Number of drinks on Thursday. Accepts raw CCHS codes or preprocessed values.}

\item{ALW_2A6}{Number of drinks on Friday. Accepts raw CCHS codes or preprocessed values.}

\item{ALW_2A7}{Number of drinks on Saturday. Accepts raw CCHS codes or preprocessed values.}
}
\value{
Integer binge drinking indicator. Missing data handled as:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{haven::tagged_na("a")} for not applicable cases (no drinking in past week)
    \item \code{haven::tagged_na("b")} for missing/invalid responses
  }
  Values: 1 = binge drinker, 2 = non-binge drinker.
}
\description{
Identify binge drinking patterns based on sex-specific daily consumption thresholds. Examines 
daily alcohol consumption across the week, applying sex-specific binge criteria for acute 
alcohol risk assessment in population health research.
}
\details{
Only applied to respondents who had alcohol in past week. Non-drinkers receive not applicable status.
Enhanced preprocessing may identify different patterns compared to legacy if_else2() implementation.

Calculation criteria: Males: Binge = ≥5 drinks on any single day; Females: Binge = ≥4 drinks on any single day.
Comprehensive preprocessing of CCHS codes (6,7,8,9 and 996-999) is applied. Priority: Not applicable > Missing > Valid assessment.

v3.0.0, last updated: 2025-06-30, status: active, Note: Enhanced with comprehensive preprocessing and modern missing data handling
