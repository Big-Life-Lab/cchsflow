\item{ALC_1}{Had drinks in past year (1=yes, 2=no). Accepts raw CCHS codes or preprocessed values.}
}
\value{
Integer short-term risk indicator. Missing data handled as:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{haven::tagged_na("a")} for not applicable cases (non-drinkers)
    \item \code{haven::tagged_na("b")} for missing/invalid responses
  }
  Values: 1 = increased short-term risk, 2 = no increased short-term risk.
}
\description{
Assess short-term health risks from drinking patterns following Canada's Low-Risk Guidelines.
Evaluates daily and weekly consumption against sex-specific acute risk thresholds for 
injury and overdose risk assessment.
}
\details{
Based on Canada's Low-Risk Alcohol Drinking Guidelines. Thresholds may differ from other national guidelines.
Non-drinkers (past year or week) receive "no increased risk" classification.

Risk criteria: Males: >4 drinks/day OR >15 drinks/week; Females: >3 drinks/day OR >10 drinks/week.
Comprehensive preprocessing with priority handling is applied. Non-drinkers are automatically 
classified as "no increased risk".
