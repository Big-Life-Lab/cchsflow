\usage{
resp_condition_fun1(DHHGAGE_cont, CCC_091, CCC_031)
}
\arguments{
\item{DHHGAGE_cont}{continuous age variable.}

\item{CCC_091}{variable indicating if respondent has either COPD or Emphysema}

\item{CCC_031}{variable indicating if respondent has asthma}
}
\value{
a categorical variable (resp_condition_der) with 3 levels:

 \enumerate{
 \item respondent is over the age of 35 and has a respiratory condition
 \item respondent is under the age of 35 and has a respiratory condition
 \item respondent does not have a respiratory condition
 }
}
\description{
This is one of 3 functions used to create a derived variable
 (resp_condition_der) that determines if a respondents has a respiratory
 condition. 3 different functions have been created to account for the fact
 that different respiratory variables are used across CCHS cycles. This
 function is for CCHS cycles (2009-2014) that only use COPD and Emphysema as
 a combined variable. Asthma is used across CCHS cycles as a separate
 variable.
}
\examples{
# Using resp_condition_fun1() to create values across CCHS cycles
# (2009-2014) resp_condition_fun1() is specified in
# variable_details.csv along with the CCHS variables and cycles included.

# To transform resp_condition_der, use rec_with_table() for each CCHS cycle
# and specify resp_condition_der, along with the various respiratory
# variables. Then by using bind_rows() you can combine resp_condition_der
# across cycles.
