\value{
Integer long-term risk indicator. Missing data handled as:

\description{
Assess long-term health risks from drinking patterns following Canada's Low-Risk Guidelines.
Evaluates daily and weekly consumption against sex-specific chronic risk thresholds for 
long-term health outcomes assessment.
}
\details{
Risk criteria: Males: >3 drinks/day OR >15 drinks/week; Females: >2 drinks/day OR >10 drinks/week.
Focus on chronic health risks (liver disease, cancer, cardiovascular). Same preprocessing and
