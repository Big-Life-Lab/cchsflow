\usage{
COPD_Emph_der_fun2(DHHGAGE_cont, CCC_091)
}
\arguments{
\item{DHHGAGE_cont}{continuous age variable.}

\item{CCC_091}{variable indicating if respondent has either COPD or Emphysema}
}
\value{
a categorical variable (COPD_Emph_der) with 3 levels:

 \enumerate{
 \item respondent is over the age of 35 and has a respiratory condition
 \item respondent is under the age of 35 and has a respiratory condition
 \item respondent does not have a respiratory condition
 }
}
\description{
This is one of 2 functions used to create a derived variable
 (COPD_Emph_der) that determines if a respondents has either COPD or 
 Emphysema. 2 different functions have been created to account for the fact
 that different respiratory variables are used across CCHS cycles. This
 function is for CCHS cycles (2001-2003, 2009-2014) that use COPD and Emphysema as
 a combined variable.
}
\examples{
# COPD_Emph_der_fun2() to create values across CCHS cycles
# (2001-2003, 2009-2014) COPD_Emph_der_fun2() is specified in
# variable_details.csv along with the CCHS variables and cycles included.

# To transform COPD_Emph_der, use rec_with_table() for each CCHS cycle
# and specify COPD_Emph_der, along with the various respiratory
# variables. Then by using bind_rows() you can combine COPD_Emph_der
# across cycles.
