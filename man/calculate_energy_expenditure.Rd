\value{
Continuous variable for energy expenditure (energy_exp)

\description{
This function creates a derived variable for daily leisure 
energy expenditure. A MET is a conceptual value that represents energy 
expended during physical activity. The volume of activity is calculated by 
multiplying the amount of minutes of activity (by level of intensity) by the 
MET value associated with that intensity. A MET (metabolic equivalent) is 
the energy cost of activity expressed as kilocalories expended per kilogram 
of body weight per hour of activity.

In CCHS 2001-2014, PACDEE is the variable used to determine the daily 
expenditure of leisure activity for all ages. In CCHS 2015-2018, ages 12-17 
and 18+ years old have separate activity variables, where 12-17 year olds 
use PAY_XXX and 18+ year olds use PAA_XXX. Leisure activity is not directly 
measured. We used the derived variable, PAADVVOL, and removed active 
transportation in the new function. With this function, we combined leisure 
activity for ages 12+. We calculate the daily energy expenditure which uses 
the frequency and duration per session of the physical activity as well as 
the MET value (3 METS for leisure and 6 METS for vigorous activity).

EE (Daily Energy Expenditure) = ((N X D X METvalue) / 60)/7
Where: 
N = the number of times a respondent engaged in an activity over a 7 day period
D = the average duration in minutes of the activity
MET value = the energy cost of the activity expressed as kilocalories 
expended per kilogram of body 
weight per hour of activity (kcal/kg per hour)
