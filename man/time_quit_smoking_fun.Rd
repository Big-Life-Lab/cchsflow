\title{Time since quit smoking (unified approach)}
\usage{
time_quit_smoking_fun(
  SMK_09A_B,
  SMKG09C,
  min_SMKG09C = NULL,
  max_SMKG09C = NULL,
  validate_params = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{SMK_09A_B}{number of years since quitting smoking. Variable asked to
former daily smokers who quit <3 years ago.}

\item{SMKG09C}{number of years since quitting smoking. Variable asked to
former daily smokers who quit >=3 years ago. Can be categorical (1,2,3) or continuous.}

\item{min_SMKG09C}{minimum valid value for SMKG09C (NULL for no validation)}

\item{max_SMKG09C}{maximum valid value for SMKG09C (NULL for no validation)}

\item{validate_params}{logical, enable parameter validation (auto-detected if NULL)}
}
\value{
value for time since quit smoking in time_quit_smoking_der.
}
\description{
This function creates a derived variable (time_quit_smoking_der)
 that calculates the approximate time a former smoker has quit smoking based
 on various CCHS smoking variables. This variable is for CCHS respondents in
 CCHS surveys 2003-2014.
}
\note{
v2.2.0, last updated: 2025-06-30, status: active, Note: Modernized with improved time calculation and validation
}
\examples{
# Standard CCHS processing (basic mode)
time_quit_smoking_fun(SMK_09A_B = 4, SMKG09C = 2)  # Returns 8 years

# Research with validation (enhanced mode)
time_quit_smoking_fun(SMK_09A_B = 4, SMKG09C_cont = 15,
                      min_SMKG09C = 3, max_SMKG09C = 82)  # Returns 15 years
