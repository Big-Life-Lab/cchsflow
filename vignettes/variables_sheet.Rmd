## Introduction

This vignette describes how the `variables.csv` worksheet is organized and how to find variables that you can transform. See also the vignette `variable_details.csv`. The [Get Started](https://big-life-lab.github.io/cchsflow/articles/get_started.html) vignette provides examples of how to use the two worksheets. 

Read `variables.csv`

```{r Read variables.csv, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(readr)
variables <- read.csv(file.path(getwd(), '../inst/extdata/variables.csv'))

cat("There are", nrow(variables), "variables, grouped in", sum(!duplicated(variables$subject)),
    "subjects and", sum(!duplicated(variables$section)), "sections that are available for
    transformation in CCHS cycles from 2001 to 2014.", "\n\n")

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
cat("You can search for variables in the table below. Try searching for the", 
    sum(variables$subject == "Age"), "age variables that are used in the Transform
    CCHS variables vignette. All", sum(variables$subject == "Age"),
    "variables are in the age subject. Try sorting the subject column by clicking
    the up beside the `subject` heading: the top", sum(variables$subject == "Age"),
    "rows of the table should show the age variables:") 

as.character(variables[variables$subject == "Age", "variable"])
```

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis', warning=FALSE}
library(DT)
datatable(variables, filter = 'top', options = list(pageLength = 5))
```


## How the `variables.csv` sheet is organized

In each row there are 7 columns in this worksheet and they are as follows:

1. **variable:** the name of the final transformed variable.

2. **label:** the shorthand label for the variable.

3. **labelLong:** a more detailed label for the variable.

4. **section:** the section where this variable could be found (i.e. demographic, health behaviour, chronic diseases).

5. **subject:** what the variable pertains to (i.e. age, smoking, sex).

6. **variableType:** whether the final variable is categorical or continuous.

7. **units:** any units for the final variable.

8. **databaseStart:** the list of CCHS surveys that contain the variable of interest

9. **variableStart:** the original names of the variables as they are listed in each respective CCHS cycle

## Derived Variables

Derived variables follow the same naming conventions as CCHS variables when being listed in `variables.csv`. 

## Contributing or customizing `variables.csv`

We recommend that you copy `variables.csv` with the variables that you use for your project. You can include only the variables that you use for your project, thereby providing a reference for your project. `variables.csv` is a CSV file to allow use `cchsflow` within teams that do not use R or have programming experience. 

You can create your own transformed or derived variables by using the cchsflow `variables.csv` as a template. We welcome [issues](https://github.com/Big-Life-Lab/cchsflow/issues) for comments to existing variables in `variables.csv. Also welcomed are PR for new transformations that you feel are helpful for others who use the CCHS data. See [Contributing](https://big-life-lab.github.io/cchsflow/CONTRIBUTING.html).
