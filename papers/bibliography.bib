  abstract = {As with other fields, medical sciences are subject to different sources of bias. While understanding sources of bias is a key element for drawing valid conclusions, bias in health research continues to be a very sensitive issue that can affect the focus and outcome of investigations. Information bias, otherwise known as misclassification, is one of the most common sources of bias that affects the validity of health research. It originates from the approach that is utilized to obtain or confirm study measurements. This paper seeks to raise awareness of information bias in observational and experimental research study designs as well as to enrich discussions concerning bias problems. Specifying the types of bias can be essential to limit its effects and, the use of adjustment methods might serve to improve clinical evaluation and health care practice.},

  abstract = {Background The lack of accessible and structured documentation creates major barriers for investigators interested in understanding, properly interpreting and analyzing cohort data and biological samples. Providing the scientific community with open information is essential to optimize usage of these resources. A cataloguing toolkit is proposed by Maelstrom Research to answer these needs and support the creation of comprehensive and user-friendly study- and network-specific web-based metadata catalogues. Methods Development of the Maelstrom Research cataloguing toolkit was initiated in 2004. It was supported by the exploration of existing catalogues and standards, and guided by input from partner initiatives having used or pilot tested incremental versions of the toolkit. Results The cataloguing toolkit is built upon two main components: a metadata model and a suite of open-source software applications. The model sets out specific fields to describe study profiles; characteristics of the subpopulations of participants; timing and design of data collection events; and datasets/variables collected at each data collection event. It also includes the possibility to annotate variables with different classification schemes. When combined, the model and software support implementation of study and variable catalogues and provide a powerful search engine to facilitate data discovery. Conclusions The Maelstrom Research cataloguing toolkit already serves several national and international initiatives and the suite of software is available to new initiatives through the Maelstrom Research website. With the support of new and existing partners, we hope to ensure regular improvements of the toolkit.},

  abstract = {Aims. To investigate the relative validity of retrospectively calculated pack-years (py-retro) by comparing py-retro with prospectively calculated pack-years (py-pro). Design. A 23-year ongoing cohort study (1977-2000). Participants. One hundred and fifty-four males and females, 13 years old in 1977 and 36 years old in 2000. Setting. Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Measurements. To calculate py-pro, current smoking and quitting efforts were investigated nine times in a period of 23 years with the help of an interview or a questionnaire. At the age of 36, subjects filled out a comprehensive questionnaire about their smoking history, to calculate py-retro. Individual differences between py-pro and py-retro were calculated. In addition, Cohen's kappa was calculated after categorising py-pro and py-retro into three groups. Findings. (1) Py-retro does not under- or overestimate life-time tobacco smoking. (2) The relative validity of py-retro was moderate due to large individual differences between py-pro and py-retro. (3) The individual differences between py-pro and py-retro became larger, the higher the number of pack-years. (4) Mean difference (and 95{\%} limits of agreement) between py-pro and py-retro was -0.039 (-5.23, 5.32) when average pack-years was {\textless}5.2 and -1.17 (-10.00, 14.65) when pack-years ≥5.2. 5. Cohen's kappa between categorized py-pro and py-retro was 0.79. Conclusions. Future researchers in the field of smoking should be aware of the moderate relative validity of py-retro. Categorizing py-retro into smoking groups results in a misclassification error that is smaller than the quantitative error in continuous py-retro, but goes together with a loss of information.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Life expectancy (LE) and health expectancy have increased throughout much of the world. However, these gains have not been shared equally across all population groups. Socioeconomic disparities exist, though varied methodologies and data sources have made it difficult to ascertain changes over time in Canada. DATA AND METHODS: The 1996 and 2011 Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohorts, with a five-year mortality follow-up, were used to estimate the LE of the household population at ages 25 and 65, according to individual-level education and income. Health status was measured by the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 instrument in two national population health surveys and was used to adjust LE to estimate health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE). Disparities in LE and HALE, and differences between cohorts, were examined. RESULTS: LE, HALE and the ratio of HALE to LE were greater at higher levels of education or income. A stepwise gradient was also observed by level of education within and across income quintiles, with people in the lowest combined education and income categories at the greatest disadvantage. Disparities were wider in the 2011 cohort compared with the 1996 cohort, but not necessarily to the same extent for both sexes or at different ages. DISCUSSION: In Canada, education-related and income-related disparities in life and health expectancy persist and may be wider than they were in the past. This underscores the importance of ongoing data development for routine monitoring of trends in mortality and morbidity, which can, in turn, inform policy development and planning to advance health equity.},

Known-group comparisons were also included in the validation process. Methods: We specified a priori hypotheses about the expected degree of association between the measures. Correlation coefficients of {\textless}0.1 were defined as negligible, 0.1 to {\textless}0.3 as small, 0.3 to {\textless}0.5 as medium, and ≤0.5 as large. Data from the Statistics Canada National Population Health Survey (NPHS) Cycle 2 (1996/97) for respondents 20 years of age or older (n = 66,435) were used to test the a priori hypotheses. Results: In 58.1{\%} of cases, predictions of association were correct. Predictions were off by one category in 38.9{\%} of cases and a priori predictions were off by two categories in 3.0{\%} of cases. Conclusions: Our results provide evidence supporting the cross-sectional construct validity of the HUI3 emotion and HUI3 in a nationally representative sample of the community-dwelling population. The results also provide further evidence of the cross-sectional construct validity of the HUI3 in assessing population health. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Exploring cost-effectiveness in the context of societal decision-making for resource allocation purposes, this volume proposes that analysts include a "reference-case" analysis in all CEAs designed to inform resource allocation and puts forth the most explicit set of guidelines (together with their rationale) ever defined on the conduct of CEAs. Important theoretical and practical issues encountered in measuring costs and effectiveness, evaluating outcomes, discounting, and dealing with uncertainty are examined in separate chapters. Additional chapters on framing and reporting of CEAs elucidate the purpose of the analysis and the effective communication of its findings. Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine differs from the available literature in several key aspects. Most importantly, it represents a consensus on standard methods-a feature integral to a CEA, whose principal goal is to permit comparisons of the costs and health outcomes of alternative ways of improving health. The detailed level at which the discussion is offered is another major distinction of this book, since guidelines in journal literature and in CEA-related books tend to be rather general-to the extent that the analyst is left with little guidance on specific matters. The focused overview of the theoretical background underlying areas of controversy and of methodological alternatives, and, finally, the accessible writing style make this volume a top choice on the reading lists of analysts in medicine and public health who wish to improve practice and comparability of CEAs. The book will also appeal to decision-makers in government, managed care, and industry who wish to consider the uses and limitations of CEAs.},

  abstract = {Background: Utility scores are frequently used as preference weights when estimating quality-adjusted life years within cost-utility analyses or healthadjusted life expectancies. Though previous Canadian estimates for specific chronic conditions have been produced, these may no longer reflect current patient populations. Data and methods: Data from the 2013 and 2014 Canadian Community Health Survey were used to provide Canadian utility score norms for 17 chronic conditions. Utility scores were estimated using the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 instrument and were reported as weighted average (95{\%} confidence intervals [95{\%} CI]) values. In addition to age- and sex-stratified analyses, results were also stratified according to the number of reported chronic conditions (i.e., "none" to "five or more"). All results were weighted using sampling and bootstrapped weights provided by Statistics Canada. Results: Utility scores were estimated for 123,654 (97.2{\%}) respondents (weighted frequency = 29,337,370 [97.7{\%}]). Of the chronic conditions that were examined, asthma had the least detrimental effect (weighted average utility score = 0.803 [95{\%} CI: 0.795 to 0.811]) on respondents' utility scores, and Alzheimer's disease or any other dementia had the most detrimental effect (weighted average utility score = 0.374 [95{\%} CI: 0.323 to 0.426]). Respondents who reported suffering from no chronic conditions had, on average, the highest utility scores (weighted average utility score = 0.928 [95{\%} CI: 0.926 to 0.930]). Estimates dropped as a function of the number of reported chronic conditions. Interpretation: Utility scores differed between various chronic conditions and as a function of the number of reported chronic conditions. Results also highlighted several differences with previously published Canadian utility norms.},

  abstract  = {Clinicians and policymakers are recognizing the importance of measuring health-related quality of life (HRQL) to inform patient management and policy decisions. Self- or interviewer-administered questionnaires can be used to measure cross-sectional differences in quality of life between patients at a point in time (discriminative instruments) or longitudinal changes in HRQL within patients during a period of time (evaluative instruments). Both discriminative and evaluative instruments must be valid (really measuring what they are supposed to measure) and have a high ratio of signal to noise (reliability and responsiveness, respectively). Reliable discriminative instruments are able to reproducibly differentiate between persons. Responsive evaluative measures are able to detect important changes in HRQL during a period of time, even if those changes are small. Health-related quality of life measures should also be interpretable-that is, clinicians and policymakers must be able to identify differences in scores that correspond to trivial, small, moderate, and large differences. Two basic approaches to quality-of-life measurement are available: generic instruments that provide a summary of HRQL; and specific instruments that focus on problems associated with single disease states, patient groups, or areas of function. Generic instruments include health profiles and instruments that generate health utilities. The approaches are not mutually exclusive. Each approach has its strengths and weaknesses and may be suitable for different circumstances. Investigations in HRQL have led to instruments suitable for detecting minimally important effects in clinical trials, for measuring the health of populations, and for providing information for policy decisions.},

HUI refers to both HUI Mark 2 (HUI2) and HUI Mark 3 (HUI3) instruments. The classification systems provide compact but comprehensive frameworks within which to describe health status. The multi-attribute utility functions provide all the information required to calculate single-summary scores of health-related quality of life (HRQL) for each health state defined by the classification systems. The use of HUI in clinical studies for a wide variety of conditions in a large number of countries is illustrated. HUI provides comprehensive, reliable, responsive and valid measures of health status and HRQL for subjects in clinical studies. Utility scores of overall HRQL for patients are also used in cost-utility and cost-effectiveness analyses. Population norm data are available from numerous large general population surveys. The widespread use of HUI facilitates the interpretation of results and permits comparisons of disease and treatment outcomes, and comparisons of long-term sequelae at the local, national and international levels. {\textcopyright} 2003 Horsman et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

  abstract  = {The terms health, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and quality of life (QoL) are used interchangeably. Given that these are three key terms in the literature, their appropriate and clear use is important. This paper reviews the history and definitions of the terms and considers how they have been used. It is argued that the definitions of HRQoL in the literature are problematic because some definitions fail to distinguish between HRQoL and health or between HRQoL and QoL. Many so-called HRQoL questionnaires actually measure self-perceived health status and the use of the phrase QoL is unjustified. It is concluded that the concept of HRQoL as used now is confusing. A potential solution is to define HRQoL as the way health is empirically estimated to affect QoL or use the term to only signify the utility associated with a health state.},

  abstract = {Background: Health decision-making requires evidence from high-quality data. As one example, the Discharge Abstract Database (DAD) compiles data from the majority of Canadian hospitals to form one of the most comprehensive and highly regarded administrative health databases available for health research, internationally. However, despite the success of this and other administrative health data resources, little is known about their history or the factors that have led to their success. The purpose of this paper is to provide an historical overview of Canadian administrative health data for health research to contribute to the institutional memory of this field. Methods: We conducted a qualitative content analysis of approximately 20 key sources to construct an historical narrative of administrative health data in Canada. Specifically, we searched for content related to key events, individuals, challenges, and successes in this field over time. Results: In Canada, administrative health data for health research has developed in tangent with provincial research centres. Interestingly, the lessons learned from this history align with the original recommendations of the 1964 Royal Commission on Health Services: (1) standardization, and (2) centralization of data resources, that is (3) facilitated through governmental financial support. Conclusions: The overview history provided here illustrates the need for longstanding partnerships between government and academia, for classification, terminology and standardization are time-consuming and ever-evolving processes. This paper will be of interest to those who work with administrative health data, and also for countries that are looking to build or improve upon their use of administrative health data for decision-making.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To estimate the burden of illness from chronic disease and injury using a population based health survey, which contains both measures of chronic disease and a utility based health related quality of life (HRQOL) measure. Design: An adapted Sullivan method was used to calculate cause deleted health adjusted life expectancies for chronic conditions. Setting: Ontario, Canada, 1996/97. Subjects: The 1996/97 Ontario Health Survey (n=35 527) was used to estimate the prevalence of chronic conditions. A cause deleted approach was used to estimate the impact of these conditions on the Health Utilities Index (HUI). Cause deleted probabilities of dying were derived with the cause eliminated life table technique and death data from vital statistics for Ontario 1996/97 (n= 156 610). Results: Eliminating cardiovascular disease and cancer will cause an "expansion of morbidity", while eliminating mental conditions and musculosketal disorders will result in a "contraction of morbidity". The HUI score varies depending on chronic condition, age, and sex - most of which were assumed not to vary in previous summary measures of population health. Conclusions: Health adjusted life expectancy estimated for chronic conditions using a utility based measure of health related quality of life from population health surveys addresses several limitations of previous studies that estimate the burden of disease using either a categorical measure of disability or expert opinion and related epidemiological evidence.},

  abstract = {Background: Behaviours such as smoking, poor diet, physical inactivity, and unhealthy alcohol consumption are leading risk factors for death. We assessed the Canadian burden attributable to these behaviours by developing, validating, and applying a multivariable predictive model for risk of all-cause death. Methods: A predictive algorithm for 5 y risk of death—the Mortality Population Risk Tool (MPoRT)—was developed and validated using the 2001 to 2008 Canadian Community Health Surveys. There were approximately 1 million person-years of follow-up and 9,900 deaths in the development and validation datasets. After validation, MPoRT was used to predict future mortality and estimate the burden of smoking, alcohol, physical inactivity, and poor diet in the presence of sociodemographic and other risk factors using the 2010 national survey (approximately 90,000 respondents). Canadian period life tables were generated using predicted risk of death from MPoRT. The burden of behavioural risk factors attributable to life expectancy was estimated using hazard ratios from the MPoRT risk model. Findings: The MPoRT 5 y mortality risk algorithms were discriminating (C-statistic: males 0.874 [95{\%} CI: 0.867–0.881]; females 0.875 [0.868–0.882]) and well calibrated in all 58 predefined subgroups. Discrimination was maintained or improved in the validation cohorts. For the 2010 Canadian population, unhealthy behaviour attributable life expectancy lost was 6.0 years for both men and women (for men 95{\%} CI: 5.8 to 6.3 for women 5.8 to 6.2). The Canadian life expectancy associated with health behaviour recommendations was 17.9 years (95{\%} CI: 17.7 to 18.1) greater for people with the most favourable risk profile compared to those with the least favourable risk profile (88.2 years versus 70.3 years). Smoking, by itself, was associated with 32{\%} to 39{\%} of the difference in life expectancy across social groups (by education achieved or neighbourhood deprivation). Conclusions: Multivariable predictive algorithms such as MPoRT can be used to assess health burdens for sociodemographic groups or for small changes in population exposure to risks, thereby addressing some limitations of more commonly used measurement approaches. Unhealthy behaviours have a substantial collective burden on the life expectancy of the Canadian population.},

Distributed networks are efficient, by interrogating data on very large populations. The structure of these networks can also be leveraged to improve replicability, increase transparency, and reduce bias. We describe some features of distributed networks using, as examples, the Canadian Network for Observational Drug Effect Studies, the Sentinel System in the USA, and the European Research Network of Pharmacovigilance and Pharmacoepidemiology. Common protocols, analysis plans, and data models, with policies on amendments and protocol violations, are key features. These tools ensure that studies can be audited and repeated as necessary. Blinding and strict conflict of interest policies reduce the potential for bias in analyses and interpretation. These developments should improve the timeliness and accuracy of information used to support both clinical and regulatory decisions.},

We make a further contribution by evaluating code sharing policies, supplemental materials policies, and open access status for these 170 journals for each of 2011 and 2012. We build a predictive model of open data and code policy adoption as a function of impact factor and publisher and find higher impact journals more likely to have open data and code policies and scientific societies more likely to have open data and code policies than commercial publishers. We also find open data policies tend to lead open code policies, and we find no relationship between open data and code policies and either supplemental material policies or open access journal status. Of the journals in this study, 38{\%} had a data policy, 22{\%} had a code policy, and 66{\%} had a supplemental materials policy as of June 2012. This reflects a striking one year increase of 16{\%} in the number of data policies, a 30{\%} increase in code policies, and a 7{\%} increase in the number of supplemental materials policies.

This article presents such an index--Health-Adjusted Life Expectancy (HALE)--as one possibility in a range of indicators. In contrast to conventional life expectancy, which considers all years as equal, to calculate HALE, years of life are weighted by health status. To measure health status, the Health Utility Index, obtained from 1994-95 National Population Health Survey data, was used. Traditional life expectancy and HALE figures are compared to estimate the burden of ill health. The societal burden of ill health is higher for women than for men, and is highest among those in "early" old age, not among the most elderly. The data further indicate that sensory problems and pain comprise the largest components of the burden of ill health, and that higher socioeconomic status confers a dual advantage--longer life expectancy and a lower burden of ill health.},

While the survey remains relatively consistent over the years, there are differences between cycles that pose a challenge to analyze the survey over time. Intervention A program package called cchsflow was developed to transform and harmonize CCHS variables to consistent formats across multiple survey cycles. An open science approach was used to maintain transparency, reproducibility and collaboration. Outcomes The cchsflow R package uses CCHS survey data between 2001 and 2014. Worksheets were created that identify variables, their names in previous cycles, their category structure, and their final variable names. These worksheets were then used to recode variables in each CCHS cycle into consistently named and labelled variables. Following, survey cycles can be combined. The package was then added as a GitHub repository to encourage collaboration with other researchers. Implication The cchsflow package has been added to the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and contains support for over 160 CCHS variables, generating a combined data set of over 1 million respondents. By implementing open science practices, cchsflow aims to minimize the amount of time needed to clean and prepare data for the many CCHS users across Canada. Résumé Contexte L'Enquête sur la santé dans les collectivités canadiennes (ESCC) est l'une des plus grandes enquêtes transversales sur la santé de la population, avec plus de 130 000 sondés tous les deux ans et plus de 1,1 million de sondés depuis son début en 2001. Tant que l'enquête reste relativement cohérent, il y a des différences entre des cycles qui posent une challenge majeure pour analyser l'enquête au fil du temps. Intervention Un paquet de programme appelé cchsflow a été développé pour transformer et harmoniser les variables CCHS aux formats cohérents à travers plusieurs cycles de sondage. Une approche de science ouverte était utilisée pour maintenir la transparence, la reproductibilité et la collaboration.},
