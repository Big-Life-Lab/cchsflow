## Abstract

**Authors:** Warsame Yusuf, Methodologist. Ottawa Hospital Research Institute. Douglas G. Manuel, Senior Scientist & Physician, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute.

**Setting:** Open science refers to research that is transparent and publicly accessible. This includes the sharing of literature, data, and code. The Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) is a cross-sectional survey with over 130,000 respondents. While the survey remains relatively consistent over the years, there are major differences between cycles that requires researchers to spend time cleaning & preparing the datasets, taking time away from data analysis. 

**Intervention:** The objectives of this project is to develop a package that transforms & harmonizes CCHS variables across multiple survey cycles, generating a library of variables that can be used for health data research. This package would minimize the amount of time spent cleaning and transforming CCHS datasets for health data research. 

**Outcomes:** The _cchsflow_ R package was developed that uses CCHS survey data between 2001 and 2014. Specification worksheets were created that identify variables, their names in previous cycles, their category structure, and their final variable names. These worksheets were then used to recode variables in each CCHS cycle, creating harmonized datasets that can be easily combined into one labelled dataset for analysis. The package was then added as a GitHub repository to encourage collaboration with other researchers.

**Implication:** The _cchsflow_ package has been added to the Comprehensive R Network; and contains support for over 140 CCHS variables, generating a dataset of over 1 million respondents. By implementing open science practices, _cchsflow_ aims to minimize the amount of time needed to clean & prepare data for the many CCHS users across Canada.
