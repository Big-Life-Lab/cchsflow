## Abstract
The Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) is one of the world's robust ongoing cross-sectional population health surveys, with over 130,000 respondents every two years or over 1.5 million respondents since its inception in 2001. While the survey remains relatively consistent over the years, differences between cycles present a challenge when conducting longitudinal analyses. _cchsflow_ is an open-source package that transforms and harmonizes variables into consistent formats across multiple CCHS cycles (currently, 2001 to 2018). An open science approach was used to maintain transparency, accessibility, reproducibility, and collaboration. Worksheets were used to guide the variable transformation process and to generate harmonized metadata. A GitHub repository was created for the package [@cchsflow] to encourage collaboration with other researchers. Currently, _cchsflow_ package is available for installation through the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and contains support for over 300 CCHS variables for 1.5 million respondents of the CCHS Public Use Microdata File (PUMF) from 2001 to 2018. _cchsflow_ also includes the “share” version of CCHS that is used in Statistics Canada Regional Data Centres and other settings. _cchsflow_ has been published in the Canadian Journal of Public Health [@Yusuf2021] as an innovative tool to further advance Canadian health research. By implementing open science practices, _cchsflow_ aims to minimize the amount of time spent data cleaning for the many CCHS users across Canada.
