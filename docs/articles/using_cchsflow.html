<p>The <code><a href="../reference/rec_with_table.html">rec_with_table()</a></code> and <code><a href="../reference/set_data_labels.html">set_data_labels()</a></code> functions are part of cchsflow. <code><a href="../reference/rec_with_table.html">rec_with_table()</a></code> is used to transform CCHS variables to a common name. <code><a href="../reference/set_data_labels.html">set_data_labels()</a></code> reapplies labels that are lost during the combination process after transforming each CCHS dataset. <code>variables.csv</code> &amp; <code>variable_details.csv</code> are also saved in the cchsflow package as <code>variables</code> &amp; <code>variable_details</code>. This means you will need to install &amp; load the package onto your environment. Install &amp; load the package onto your environment.</p>

<a href="#step-1--load-the-cchs-datasets" class="anchor"></a>Step 1. Load the CCHS datasets</h3>
<p>Load the CCHS datasets as well as the two variable worksheets. There are sample datasets for each CCHS cycle saved in <code>cchsflow</code>. For this vignette we will use sample data from the 2001 and 2012 CCHS cycles. See <a href="../reference/index.html">Reference</a> for more information of each CCHS cycle.</p>
<p>Did you notice that the names for the variables are slightly different in the two mock databases? That isn’t a mistake: in the 2001 CCHS the variable for sex is <code>DHHA_SEX</code> and in 2012 CCHS the variable is <code>DHH_SEX</code>.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, <code>cchsflow</code> is here to help! <code>variable_details.csv</code> contains the rules on how to harmonize those two variables into a common variable name. In the CCHS, the categories for <code>sex</code> are consistent: 1 = males, 2 = females. <code>variable_details.csv</code> provides instructions for how to harmonize category values and labels, if they change across survey cycles. Variable labels are discussed in later vignettes.</p>

<code>var_labels</code> is set to NULL. This argument can be used to add labels to a transformed dataset that only contains a subset of variables from <code>variables.csv</code>.

<a href="#example-3--transform-a-single-variable-from-multiple-databases-that-changes-categories-between-cycles-" class="anchor"></a>Example 3. Transform a single variable from multiple databases that changes categories between cycles.</h3>
<p>There are many variables in the CCHS that changes in categories between cycles in a way that the variable cannot preserve all categories for all CCHS cycles. An example is the categorical variable for <code>age</code>. <code>cchsflow</code> offers three options to facilitate the use of these variables with inconsistent categories across cycles.</p>

<p>Transform the <code>age</code> variable into variables that cannot be combined across cycles. The categories in <code>age</code> variable in the CCHS changed in 2005 and therefore it is not possible to have the same <code>age</code> categories across all CCHS cycles.</p>
<p><code>DHHGAGE_A</code> is the age variable for CCHS cycles 2001-2003, and <code>DHHGAGE_B</code> is the age variable for CCHS cycles 2005-2014.</p>

<p>CCHS derived variables are recoded (harmonized) using the same method as other CCHS <code>cchsflow</code> variables, with one additional considerations.</p>
<p>Derived variables in CCHS are created from existing, original variables that are transformed into a new variable. An example is body mass index (BMI). Respondents are asked to report their height and weight. BMI is then derived (calculated) using recoded variables for height and weight.</p>
<p>Recoding <code>BMI</code> into a harmonized variable requires their underlying initial variables (height and weight). This first step of harmonizing underlying variables is completed for you, but you must have the underlying variables in your dataset.</p>
<p>Using the BMI example illustrated in the <a href="derived_variables.html">derived variables</a> article, <code><a href="../reference/rec_with_table.html">rec_with_table()</a></code> is able to transform BMI across multiple cycles provided that height (<code>HWTGHTM</code>) and weight (<code>HWTGWTK</code>) are specified.</p>

<p><code>notes</code> provide context for the decisions that informed harmonization that may affect your decision to use a harmonized variable.</p>

<pre><code>## `cchsflow` includes 40 variables with notes.</code></pre>
<p>For example, for <code>DHHGAGE_A</code> the category <code>NA::b</code> has the following <code>note</code>:</p>
<p><code>Not applicable, don't know, refusal, not stated (96-99) were options only in CCHS 2003, but had zero responses</code>.</p>
<p>This note informs the decision to combine values 96 to 99 in <code>DHHGAGE_A</code> for CCHS2003 into one common missing value <code>NA::b</code>. The label for the <code>NA::b</code> category is, “<code>don't know (97); refusal (98); not stated (99)</code>”.</p>
<p>By default, <code><a href="../reference/rec_with_table.html">rec_with_table()</a></code> prints notes to the console.</p>

<div id="warning-messages" class="section level2">

<p>Warning messages will appear when your dataset is missing variables in your <code>variables</code> worksheet or <code><a href="../reference/rec_with_table.html">rec_with_table()</a></code> call.</p>
