<a href="#rows" class="anchor"></a>Rows</h3>
<p>Each row in <code>variableDetails.csv</code> holds the recode rules for transforming a single category for a variable in <code>variables.csv</code>. An exception to this rule are the “don’t know”, “refusal”, and “not stated” categories, which are combined as a single missing category. For each unique variable, an <code>else</code> row is used to assign values not identified in other rows. We recommend not combining variables across the CCHS if variable has an important change between CCHS cycles <code>variableDetails$notes</code> is used to identify issues that may be relevant when transforming the variable or category.</p>
<p>Additional information how to create and use <code>variableDetails.csv</code> is in the <code>bllflow</code> package. The <code>bllflow</code> package includes additional helper functions for creating <code>variableDetails.csv</code> using the CCHS Data Document Initiative (DDI) files located in <code>..inst\extdata\CCHS_DDI</code>.</p>
<p>If a categorical variable has 4 distinct categories, along with a “not applicable” category and the 3 missing categories, there will be 7 rows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>4 for each distinct category</p></li>
<li><p>1 for the not appliacble category</p></li>
<li><p>1 for the missing categories</p></li>
<li><p>1 else row.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><code>RecWTable()</code> uses the <code>tagged_na()</code> function from the <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/haven/versions/2.1.1">haven</a> package to tag not applicable responses as <code>NA(a)</code>, and missing values (don’t know, refusal, not stated) as <code>NA(b)</code>. As you will see later, not applicable values are transformed to <code>NA::a</code>, and missing values are transformed to <code>NA::b</code>.</p>

<p>The following are the columns that are listed in <code>variableDetails.csv</code>. Many of these columns need to be specified in order for <code>RecWTable</code> to be functional. We will use the <code>sex</code> variable to illustrate how each column is specified:</p>

<li>For categorical variables that are not changing variable types (i.e. cat to cat), it is ideal to retain the same values as indicated in each CCHS survey. But for transformed categorical variables that have changed in type (i.e cat to cont), you will have to develop values that make the most sense to your analysis. In <code>variableDetails.csv</code>, variables that have gone from cat to cont have used midpoints of each category.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="8" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>numValidCat:</strong> the number of categories for a variable. This only applies to variables in which the <strong>toType</strong> is cat. For continuous variables, <code>numValidCat = N/A</code>. Not applicable, missing, and else categories are not included in the category count. Note that this column is not necessary for <code>RecWTable()</code>.</li>

<strong>recFrom:</strong> the range of values for a particular category in a variable as indicated in the CCHS. See CCHS data documentation for each survey cycle and use the smallest and large values as your range to capture all values between the survey years.</li>

<p>The rules for each category of a new variable are a string in <code>recFrom</code> and value in <code>recTo</code>. These recode pairs are the same syntax as <code>{sjmisc::rec()</code> – for more details see <a href="">bllflow::RecWTable()</a>. Recode pairs are obtained from the RecFrom and RecTo columns <em>multiple values</em> that are recoded into a new single value are separated with comma, e.g. <code>recFrom = "1,2"; recTo = 1</code> <em>value range</em> is indicated by a colon, e.g. <code>recFrom= "1:4"; recTo = 1</code> (recodes all values from 1 to 4 into 1} <em>value range</em> for double vectors (with fractional part), all values within the specified range are recoded; e.g. <code>recFrom = "1:2.5"; recTo = 1</code> recodes 1 to 2.5 into 1, but 2.55 would not be recoded (since it’s not included in the specified range) <em>minimum and maximum values</em> are indicates by <code>min</code> (or <code>lo</code>) and <code>max</code> (or <code>hi</code>), e.g. <code>recFrom = "min:4"; recTo = 1</code> (recodes all values from minimum values to 4 into 1) <em>NA</em> is used for missing values (don’t know, refusal, not stated) <em>else</em> is used all other values, which have not been specified yet, are indicated by <code>else</code>, e.g. <code>recFrom = "else"; recTo = NA</code> (recode all other values (not specified in other rows) to “NA”)} <em>copy</em> the <code>else</code> token can be combined with <code>copy</code>, indicating that all remaining, not yet recoded values should stay the same (are copied from the original value), e.g. <code>recFrom = "else"; recTo = "copy"</code></p>

<li>For this variable, there are 4 rows, 1 for the continuous “category”, 1 for not applicable, 1 for missing, and 1 for else. However, CCHS 2001 and 2003 code not applicable and the missing categories differently from other cycles so two extra rows will be created to account for this. In many instances there are changes in how variable categories are coded between CCHS cycles. But since the overall variable structure remains intact, extra rows can be used to help rectify this issue to make sure all values feed into the newly transformed variable.</li>

<strong>recFrom:</strong> Going through the CCHS data documentation from 2001 to 2014, it was found that the lowest BMI value was 11.91 and the highest BMI value was 57.9. Therefore the recFrom for the first row is written as <code>11.91:57.9</code>. In the 2001 and 2003 CCHS surveys not applicable was coded as 999.6 so the recFrom for this row would be <code>999.6:999.6</code>. Similarly, in the 2001 and 2003 CCHS surveys don’t know was coded as 999.7, refusal was coded as 999.8, and not stated was coded as 999.9. Therefore the recFrom for the missing row for CCHS 2001 and 2003 would be <code>999.7:999.9</code>. In the not applicable row for the 2005 CCHS survey onwards, the recFrom is <code>999.96:999.96</code>. In the missing row for CCHS 2005 onwards, the recFrom is <code>999.97:999.99</code>. For the else row, just write <code>else</code>.</li>

<strong>notes: </strong> As described previously, there are differences between CCHS surveys with regards to coding the not applicable and missing categories. These are documented in this section. Aside from this, there are other changes and differences that should also be documented. In the 2001 CCHS survey, this variable was restricted to participants aged 20-64. As well, don’t know (999.97) and refusal (999.98) were not asked in this survey.</li>
