<p>The <code>RecWTable</code> and <code>SetDataLabels</code> functions are part of the <a href="https://bllflow.projectbiglife.ca/index.html">bllflow</a> package. <code>RecWTable</code> is used to transform CCHS variables to a common name. <code>SetDataLabels</code> reapplies labels that are lost during the combination process after transforming each CCHS dataset. Install &amp; load the package onto your environment. Since <code>bllflow</code> is still under development and is not on CRAN, you must install the package from Github using the <code>devtools</code> package.</p>

<p>Did you notice that the names for the variables are slightly different in the two mock databases? That isn’t a mistake: in the 2001 CCHS the variable for sex is <code>DHHA_SEX</code> and in 2013 CCHS the variable is <code>DHH_SEX</code>.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, <code>cchsflow</code> is here to help! <code>variableDetails.csv</code> contains the rules to harmonize those two variables into a common variable name. In the CCHS, the categories for <code>sex</code> are consistient: 1 = males, 2 = females. <code>variableDetails.csv</code> provides instructions for how to harmonizecategory values or labels, if they change across survey cycles. Variable labes are discussed in later vignettes.</p>

<p>To call the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/bllflow/man/RecWTable.html">RecWTable()</a></code> function to transform the variables of a CCHS dataset:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create a name for your transformed dataset (e.g. cchsYear1)</li>
<li>Indicate the database of the CCHS dataset in the <code>dataSource</code> argument</li>
<li>Indicate the name of <code>variableDetails.csv</code> in the <code>variableDetails</code> argument</li>
<li>Indicate the name of the CCHS dataset (this can be found in the databaseStart section of <code>variableDetails.csv</code>).</li>
</ol>
<p>Your R command when calling the function should look like this:</p>

<a href="#example-5--transform-cchs-derived-variables-such-as-body-mass-index-bmi" class="anchor"></a>Example 5. Transform CCHS derived variables such as Body Mass Index (BMI)</h3>
<p>CCHS derived variables are recoded (harmonized) using the same method as other CCHS <code>cchsflow</code> variables, with one additional considerations.</p>
<p>Derived variables in CCHS are created from existing, original variables that are transformed into a new variable. An example is body mass index (BMI). Respondents are asked to report their height and weight. BMI is then dereived (calculated) using variables for height and weight.</p>
<p>Recoding <code>BMI</code> into a harmonized variable requires their underlying initial variables (height and weight). This first step of harmonizing underlying variables is completed for you, but you must have the underlying variables in your dataset.</p>
<p>Using the BMI example illustrated in the <a href="'~../Vignettes/derivedVariables.html'">derivedVariables</a> article, <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/bllflow/man/RecWTable.html">RecWTable()</a></code> is able to transform BMI across multiple cycles provided that height (<code>HWTGHTM</code>) and weight (<code>HWTGWTK</code>) are specified.</p>
<p>For this example, we will use a subset of CCHS 2003 and 2010 data.</p>

<pre><code>## `cchsflow` includes 33 variables with notes.</code></pre>
<p>For example, for <code>DHHGAGE_A</code> the category <code>NA::b</code> has the following <code>note</code>:</p>
<p><code>Not applicable, don't know, refusal, not stated (96-99) were options only in CCHS 2003, but had zero responses</code>.</p>
<p>This note informs the decision to combine values 96 to 99 in <code>DHHGAGE_A</code> for CCHS2003 into one common missing value <code>NA::b</code>. The label for the <code>NA::b</code> category is, “<code>don't know (97); refusal (98); not stated (99)</code>”.</p>
