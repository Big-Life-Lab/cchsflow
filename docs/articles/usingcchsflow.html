<p>The <code>RecWTable</code> and <code>SetDataLabels</code> functions are part of the <a href="https://bllflow.projectbiglife.ca/index.html">bllflow</a> package. <code>RecWTable</code> is used to transform CCHS variables to a common name, while <code>SetDataLabels</code> reapplies labels that are lost during the combination process after transforming each CCHS dataset. You must install &amp; load the package onto your environment in order to do any transformations. Since <code>bllflow</code> is still under development and is not on CRAN, you must install the package from Github using the <code>devtools</code> package.</p>

<p>To be able to combine datasets with minimal issues, we recommend using the <code>bind_rows</code> function in the <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dplyr/versions/0.7.8">dplyr</a> package.</p>

<p>For this vignette, we will use the <code>datatable</code> function in the <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/DT/">DT</a> package to provide data tables to illustrate the transformations.</p>

<p>You will need to load the CCHS datasets as well as the two variable worksheets before you are able to do any transformations. Since CCHS datasets cannot be shared publicly, we will create mock CCHS datasets for the years 2001 and 2013 which will be used in examples later on.</p>

<p>Did you notice that the names for the variables are slightly different in the two mock databases? That isnâ€™t a mistake: in the 2001 CCHS the variable for sex is <code>DHHA_SEX</code> and in 2013 CCHS the variable is <code>DHH_SEX</code>.</p>
<p>Donâ€™t worry, <code>cchsflow</code> is here to help! <code>variableDetails.csv</code> contains the rules to harmonize those two variables into a common variable name. In the CCHS, the categories for <code>sex</code> are consistient: 1 = males, 2 = females. If the category values or labels changed, <code>variableDetails.csv</code> would provide instructions for how to harmonize them. You can learn more about these in later vignettes.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li>Indicate the database of the CCHS dataset in the <code>dataSource</code> argument</li>

<li>Indicate the full name of the CCHS dataset (this can be found in the data documentation of the CCHS dataset) in the <code>datasetName</code> argument.</li>

<a href="#example-4--transform-multiple-variables-from-multiple-datasets" class="anchor"></a>Example 4. Transform multiple variables from multiple datasets</h3>
<p>The variables argument in <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/bllflow/man/RecWTable.html">RecWTable()</a></code> is able to handle multiple variables to be transformed from a CCHS dataset. In this example, the age and sex variables from the 2001 and 2013 CCHS datasets will be transformed and labelled using <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/bllflow/man/RecWTable.html">RecWTable()</a></code>. They will then be combined into a single dataset and labelled using <code>SetDataLabels()</code>.</p>

<p>In the above code, varLabels is called in <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/bllflow/man/RecWTable.html">RecWTable()</a></code> to label the age and sex variables in the 2001 and 2013 datasets. To ensure that the variables in your dataset are labelled, use <code>get_label()</code> to view the variable labels in your transformed dataset. As mentioned previously, varLabels can be used all the variables in <code>variablesSheet.csv</code> or a subset of variables.</p>
