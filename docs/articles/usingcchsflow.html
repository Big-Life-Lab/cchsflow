<p>The <code>RecWTable</code> and <code>SetDataLabels</code> functions are part of the <a href="https://bllflow.projectbiglife.ca/index.html">bllflow</a> package. <code>RecWTable</code> is used to transform CCHS variables to a common name, while <code>SetDataLabels</code> reapplies labels that are lost during the combination process after transforming each CCHS dataset. You must install &amp; load the package onto your environment in order to do any transformations. Since <code>bllflow</code> is still under development and is not on CRAN, you must install the package from Github using the <code>devtools</code> package.</p>

<p>To be able to combine datasets with minimal issues, we recommend using the <code>bind_rows</code> function in the <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dplyr/versions/0.7.8">dplyr</a> package.</p>

<p>For this vignette, we will use the <code>datatable</code> function in the <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/DT/">DT</a> package to provide data tables to illustrate the transformations.</p>

<p>You will need to load the CCHS datasets as well as the two variable worksheets before you are able to do any transformations. Since CCHS datasets cannot be shared publicly, we will create mock CCHS datasets for the years 2001 and 2013 which will be used in examples later on.</p>

<p>Did you notice that the names for the variables are slightly different in the two mock databases? That isn’t a mistake: in the cchs2001 the variable for sex is <code>DHHA_SEX</code> and in CCHS2013 the variable is <code>DHH_SEX</code>.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, <code>cchsflow</code> is here to help! <code>variableDetails.csv</code> contains the rules to harmonize those two variables into a common variable name. In the CCHS, the categories for <code>sex</code> are consistient: 1 = males, 2 = females. If the category values or labels changed, <code>variableDetails.csv</code> would provide instructions for how to harmonize them. You can learn more about <code>variables.csv</code> and <code>variableDetails.csv</code> in later vignettes. see … and …</p>

<p>To call the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/bllflow/man/RecWTable.html">RecWTable()</a></code> function to transform the variables of a CCHS dataset:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create a name for your transformed dataset (e.g. cchsYear1)</li>
<li>Indicate the database of the CCHS dataset in the <code>dataSource</code> argument</li>
<li>Indicate the name of <code>variableDetails.csv</code> in the <code>variableDetails</code> argument</li>
<li>Indicate the full name of the CCHS dataset (this can be found in the data documentation of the CCHS dataset) in the <code>datasetName</code> argument.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your R command when calling the function should look like this:</p>
<p><code>cchsTransformedYear1 &lt;- RecWTable(dataSource = cchsYear, variableDetails = varDetails, datasetName = "cchs-Year1-general-file")</code></p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>elseValue</code> is set to NA. Else values (values out of range) will be set to NA.</li>
<li>
<code>appendToData</code> is set to FALSE. Transformed variables will not be appended to the original CCHS dataset.</li>
<li>
<code>log</code> is set to FALSE. Logs of the variable tranformations will not be displayed.</li>
<li>
<code>printNote</code> is set to TRUE. Any information in the Notes column from <code>variableDetails.csv</code> will be displayed</li>
<li>
<code>variables</code> is set to NULL. This argument can be used to add labels to the transformed dataset by setting it to the name of <code>variables.csv</code> or by specifying particular variables from <code>variables.csv</code> to transform.</li>
<li>
<code>varLabels</code> is set to NULL. This argument can be used to add labels to a transformed dataset that only contains a subset of variables from <code>variables.csv</code>.

<p>There are many variables in the CCHS that changes in categories between cycles in a way that the variable cannot perserve all categories for all CCHS cycles. An example is the categorical variable for <code>age</code>. <code>cchsflow</code> offer several options to facilitate the use of these variables with inconsisten categories across cycles.</p>

<p>The categories in <code>age</code> variable in the CCHS changed in 2005 and therefore it is not possible to have the same <code>age</code> categories across all CCHS cycels. <code>cchsflow</code> offers two optins. The first option is to transform the <code>age</code> variable into two variables. <code>DHHGAGE_A</code> is the age variable for CCHS cycles 2001-2003, and <code>DHHGAGE_B</code> is the age variable for CCHS cycles 2005-2014. With this option, you cannot combine <code>DHHGAGE_A</code> and <code>DHHGAGE_B</code> into a single dataset.</p>
