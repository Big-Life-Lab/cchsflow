<p>Each row in <code>variable_details.csv</code> holds the recode rules
for transforming a single category for a variable in
<code>variables.csv</code>. An exception to this rule are the “don’t
know”, “refusal”, and “not stated” categories, which are combined as a
single missing category. For each unique variable, an <code>else</code>
row is used to assign values not identified in other rows and are
outside identified ranges. We recommend not combining variables across
the CCHS if variable has an important change between CCHS cycles
<code>variable_details$notes</code> is used to identify issues that may
be relevant when transforming the variable or category.</p>
<p>If a categorical variable has 4 distinct categories, along with a
“not applicable” category and the 3 missing categories, there will be 7
rows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>4 for each distinct category</p></li>
<li><p>1 for the not applicable category</p></li>
<li><p>1 for the missing categories</p></li>
<li><p>1 else row.</p></li>

<li>For categorical variables that are not changing variable types
(i.e. cat to cat), it is ideal to retain the same values as indicated in
each CCHS survey. But for transformed categorical variables that have
changed in type (i.e cat to cont), you will have to develop values that
make the most sense to your analysis. In
<code>variable_details.csv</code>, variables that have gone from cat to
cont have used midpoints of each category.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="8" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>numValidCat:</strong> the number of categories for a
variable. This only applies to variables in which the
<strong>toType</strong> is cat. For continuous variables,
<code>numValidCat = N/A</code>. Not applicable, missing, and else
categories are not included in the category count. Note that this column
is not necessary for <code><a href="../reference/rec_with_table.html">rec_with_table()</a></code>.</li>

<strong>recStart:</strong> the range of values for a particular
category in a variable as indicated in the CCHS. See CCHS data
documentation for each survey cycle and use the smallest and large
values as your range to capture all values between the survey
years.</li>
</ol>
<p>The rules for each category of a new variable are a string in
<code>recFrom</code> and value in <code>recTo</code>. These recode pairs
are the same syntax as interval notation in which a closed range of
values are specified using square brackets. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)#Notations_for_intervals" class="external-link">here</a>
for more information on interval notation. Recode pairs are obtained
from the RecFrom and RecTo columns <em>value range</em> is indicated by
a comma, e.g. <code>recFrom= [1,4]; recTo = 1</code> (recodes all values
from 1 to 4 into 1} <em>value range</em> for double vectors (with
fractional part), all values within the specified range are recoded;
e.g. <code>recFrom = [1,2.5]; recTo = 1</code> recodes 1 to 2.5 into 1,
but 2.55 would not be recoded (since it’s not included in the specified
range). <em>NA</em> is used for missing values (don’t know, refusal, not
stated) <em>else</em> is used all other values, which have not been
specified yet, are indicated by <code>else</code>,
e.g. <code>recFrom = "else"; recTo = NA</code> (recode all other values
(not specified in other rows) to “NA”)} <em>copy</em> the
<code>else</code> token can be combined with <code>copy</code>,
indicating that all remaining, not yet recoded values should stay the
same (are copied from the original value),
e.g. <code>recFrom = "else"; recTo = "copy"</code></p>
