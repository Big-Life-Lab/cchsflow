<p>Each row in <code>variable_details.csv</code> holds the recode rules for transforming a single category for a variable in <code>variables.csv</code>. An exception to this rule are the “don’t know”, “refusal”, and “not stated” categories, which are combined as a single missing category. For each unique variable, an <code>else</code> row is used to assign values not identified in other rows and are outside identified ranges. We recommend not combining variables across the CCHS if variable has an important change between CCHS cycles <code>variable_details$notes</code> is used to identify issues that may be relevant when transforming the variable or category.</p>
<p>If a categorical variable has 4 distinct categories, along with a “not applicable” category and the 3 missing categories, there will be 7 rows:</p>

<li><p>4 for each distinct category</p></li>

<li>For categorical variables that are not changing variable types (i.e. cat to cat), it is ideal to retain the same values as indicated in each CCHS survey. But for transformed categorical variables that have changed in type (i.e cat to cont), you will have to develop values that make the most sense to your analysis. In <code>variable_details.csv</code>, variables that have gone from cat to cont have used midpoints of each category.</li>

<p>The same naming convention applies to derived variables with the exception of two columns:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In <strong>variableStart</strong>, instead of database names being listed, <strong>DerivedVar::</strong> is written followed with the list of CCHS variables used inside square brackets.</li>

<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In <strong>recTo</strong>, write <strong>Func::</strong> followed with the name of the custom function used to create the derived variable.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><code>Func::derivedFunction</code></li>
