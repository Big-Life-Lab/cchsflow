<p>This vignette describes <code>variables.csv</code> worksheet. See also the vignette <code>variableDetails.csv</code>. The vignette <code>Transform CCHS variables</code> provides examples of how to use the two worksheeets with the <a href="http://bllflow.projectbiglife.ca"><code>bllflow</code> package</a> to transform variables.</p>
<p>Read <code>variables.csv</code></p>
<pre><code>#&gt; There are 119 variables, grouped in 36 subjects and 6 sections that  are available for transformation in CCHS cycles from 2001 to 2014.</code></pre>
<pre><code>#&gt; You can search for variables in the table below. Try searching for the 3 age variables that are used in the Transform CCHS variables vignette. All 3 variables are in the age subject. Try sorting the subject column by clicking the up beside the `subject` heading: the top 3 rows of the table should show the age variables:
#&gt; [1] "DHHGAGE_A"    "DHHGAGE_B"    "DHHGAGE_cont"</code></pre>

<p>We recommend that you copy <code>variables.csv</code> with the variables that you use for your project. You can create your own transformed or derived variables by using the cchsflow <code>variables.csv</code> as a template. We welcome <a href="https://github.com/Big-Life-Lab/cchsflow/issues">issues</a> for comments to existing variables in `variables.csv. Also welcomed are PR for new transformations that you feel are helpful for others who use the CCHS data. See <a href="">Contributing</a>.</p>
