<p>This vignette describes how the <code>variables.csv</code> worksheet is organized and how to find variables that you can transform. See also the vignette <code>variableDetails.csv</code>. The vignette <a href="https://big-life-lab.github.io/cchsflow/articles/usingcchsflow.html">Using cchsflow</a> provides examples of how to use the two worksheeets with the <a href="http://bllflow.projectbiglife.ca"><code>bllflow</code> package</a>.</p>
<p>Read <code>variables.csv</code></p>
<pre><code>#&gt; There are 135 variables, grouped in 38 subjects and 6 sections that are available for transformation in CCHS cycles from 2001 to 2014.</code></pre>
<pre><code>#&gt; You can search for variables in the table below. Try searching for the 3 age variables that are used in the Transform CCHS variables vignette. All 3 variables are in the age subject. Try sorting the subject column by clicking the up beside the `subject` heading: the top 3 rows of the table should show the age variables:
#&gt; [1] "DHHGAGE_A"    "DHHGAGE_B"    "DHHGAGE_cont"</code></pre>

<p>We recommend that you copy <code>variables.csv</code> with the variables that you use for your project. You can include only the variables that you use for your project, thereby providing a reference for your project. <code>variables.csv</code> is a CSV file to allow use <code>cchsflow</code> within a teams that do not use R or have programming experience. <code>variables.csv</code> can also be used with <code>bllflow</code> for further data cleaning and preprocessing.</p>
<p>You can create your own transformed or derived variables by using the cchsflow <code>variables.csv</code> as a template. We welcome <a href="https://github.com/Big-Life-Lab/cchsflow/issues">issues</a> for comments to existing variables in `variables.csv. Also welcomed are PR for new transformations that you feel are helpful for others who use the CCHS data. See <a href="">Contributing</a>.</p>
