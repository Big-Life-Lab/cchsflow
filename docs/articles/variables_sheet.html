<p>This vignette describes how the <code>variables.csv</code> worksheet is organized and how to find variables that you can transform. See also the vignette <code>variable_details.csv</code>. The <a href="https://big-life-lab.github.io/cchsflow/articles/get_started.html">Get Started</a> vignette provides examples of how to use the two worksheets.</p>
<p>Read <code>variables.csv</code></p>
<pre><code>#&gt; There are 186 variables, grouped in 32 subjects and 6 sections that are available for
#&gt;     transformation in CCHS cycles from 2001 to 2014.</code></pre>
<pre><code>#&gt; You can search for variables in the table below. Try searching for the 6 age variables that are used in the Transform
#&gt;     CCHS variables vignette. All 6 variables are in the age subject. Try sorting the subject column by clicking
#&gt;     the up beside the `subject` heading: the top 6 rows of the table should show the age variables:
#&gt; [1] "DHHGAGE_A"    "DHHGAGE_B"    "DHHGAGE_C"    "DHHGAGE_cont" "DHHGAGE_5"   
#&gt; [6] "DHHGAGE_D"</code></pre>

<p>We recommend that you copy <code>variables.csv</code> with the variables that you use for your project. You can include only the variables that you use for your project, thereby providing a reference for your project. <code>variables.csv</code> is a CSV file to allow use <code>cchsflow</code> within teams that do not use R or have programming experience.</p>
<p>You can create your own transformed or derived variables by using the cchsflow <code>variables.csv</code> as a template. We welcome <a href="https://github.com/Big-Life-Lab/cchsflow/issues">issues</a> for comments to existing variables in `variables.csv. Also welcomed are PR for new transformations that you feel are helpful for others who use the CCHS data. See <a href="https://big-life-lab.github.io/cchsflow/CONTRIBUTING.html">Contributing</a>.</p>
