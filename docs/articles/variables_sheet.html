<p>This vignette describes how the <code>variables.csv</code> worksheet
is organized and how to find variables that you can transform. See also
the vignette <code>variable_details.csv</code>. The <a href="https://big-life-lab.github.io/cchsflow/articles/get_started.html">Get
Started</a> vignette provides examples of how to use the two
worksheets.</p>
<p>Read <code>variables.csv</code></p>
<pre><code><span><span class="co">#&gt; There are 337 variables, grouped in 33 subjects and 6 sections that are available for</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt;     transformation in CCHS cycles from 2001 to 2018.</span></span></code></pre>
<pre><code><span><span class="co">#&gt; You can search for variables in the table below. Try searching for the 7 age variables that are used in the Transform</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt;     CCHS variables vignette. All 7 variables are in the age subject. Try sorting the subject column by clicking</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt;     the up beside the `subject` heading: the top 7 rows of the table should show the age variables:</span></span>

<p>We recommend that you copy <code>variables.csv</code> with the
variables that you use for your project. You can include only the
variables that you use for your project, thereby providing a reference
for your project. <code>variables.csv</code> is a CSV file to allow use
<code>cchsflow</code> within teams that do not use R or have programming
experience.</p>
<p>You can create your own transformed or derived variables by using the
cchsflow <code>variables.csv</code> as a template. We welcome <a href="https://github.com/Big-Life-Lab/cchsflow/issues" class="external-link">issues</a> for
comments to existing variables in `variables.csv. Also welcomed are PR
for new transformations that you feel are helpful for others who use the
CCHS data. See <a href="https://big-life-lab.github.io/cchsflow/CONTRIBUTING.html">Contributing</a>.</p>
