## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version we have:
* Added a new function `merge_rec_data()` that merges and labels transformed
CCHS datasets.
* Improved support for `tagged_na` in derived variables.
* Improved labels for certain variables in `variables.csv` and
`variable_details.csv`.
* Added new CCHS and derived variables to library.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 4.0.0
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 4.0.0
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
