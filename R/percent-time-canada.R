#' @title Percent time in Canada
#'
#' @description This function creates a derived variable (pct_time_der) that
#'  provides an estimated percentage of the time a person's life was spent in
#'  Canada.
#'
#' @param DHHGAGE_cont continuous age variable.
#'
#' @param SDCGCBG whether or not someone was born in Canada (1 - born in Canada,
#'  2 - born outside Canada)
#'
#' @param SDCGRES how long someone has lived in Canada. Note: in the PUMF CCHS
#'  datasets, this is a categorical variable with two categories (1 - 0-9 years;
#'  2 - 10+ years).
#'
#' @note Since SDCGRES is a categorical variable measuring length of time, we've
#'  set midpoints in the function. A respondent identified as being in Canada
#'  for 0-9 years is assigned a value of 4.5 years, and someone who has been in
#'  Canada for over 10 years is assigned a value of 15 years.
#'
#' @return Numeric value that is a fraction between 0 and 1 that represents
#'  percentage of a respondent's time in Canada

#' # Using pct_time_fun() to create percent time values between CCHS cycles
#' # pct_time_fun() is specified in variable_details.csv along with the CCHS
#' # variables and cycles included.
#'
#' # To transform pct_time_der across cycles, use rec_with_table() for each CCHS
#' # cycle and specify pct_time_der, along with age (DHHGAGE_cont), whether or
#' # not someone was born in Canada (SDCGCBG), how long someone has lived in
#' # Canada (SDCGRES). Then by using bind_rows(), you can combine Pct_time_der
#' # across cycles
